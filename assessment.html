    <h2> TEXT: A little Bronco History... </h2>

      <p><b>Denver Broncos</b> The history of the Denver Broncos American football club began when the team was chartered a member of the American Football League in 1960. The Broncos have played in the city of Denver, Colorado throughout their entire history. The Broncos did not win any titles as members of the AFL. Since the 1970 AFLâ€“NFL merger, the Broncos have won 15 division titles, and played in eight Super Bowls, following the 1977, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1997, 1998, 2013, and 2015 seasons. They won Super Bowl XXXII, Super Bowl XXXIII and Super Bowl 50. Their most famous player is former quarterback John Elway, starting quarterback in five Super Bowls and holder of many NFL records. The Broncos currently play in the National Football League's AFC West division. Their current leadership includes owner Pat Bowlen, CEO Joe Ellis, VP John Elway, and head coach Vic Fangio. </p>

    <p><b><em>Trailblazers</em></b>  <i>For much of their first 3 decades, excluding teams in Texas, they were the only major pro football team between Kansas City and California (and the only team in the Interior West). This distinction ended in 1988, when the Cardinals moved from St. Louis to Phoenix. The Broncos remain the only current AFC West (formerly AFL West) team to never relocate or change its name.</i></p>

    <p><b> Origin </b> In the summer of 1959, Bob Howsam, owner of minor league baseball's Denver Bears, had a problem. He'd expanded Bears Stadium to 34,000 after Denver was named a charter member of the Continental League, a proposed third major league. However, the league died when the established major leagues granted expansion franchises to two of its cities (New York and Houston) and moved an established team to a third (the Twin Cities). Howsam was now saddled with a heavy debt load and a stadium far too big for a minor-league team.So, the AFl was born. The new league, the American Football League, announced its formation on August 14, 1959, with Howsam's Denver team as a charter member.[3] A 1960 "name-the-team" contest yielded the nickname "Broncos."[4] The first general manager of the new team was Dean Griffing, and the first head coach was Frank Filchock.</p>
